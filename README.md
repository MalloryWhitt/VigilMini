# Vigil Mini

Vigil Mini is a lightweight, deployable civic-tech web application that pulls real U.S. lobbying disclosure data from the Senate LDA API and visualizes relationships between clients, lobbying firms, and issue areas.

Influence over public policy in the United States is often exercised through complex, opaque networks of money, representation, and regulatory pressure. While lobbying disclosures are legally public, they are difficult for non-experts to interpret in their raw form. 
Vigil Mini focuses on transforming these disclosures into an interactive network that makes patterns of influence more legible and easier to reason about.

This kind of visualization is useful for journalists, researchers, policy staffers, and civic-minded members of the public who want to better understand how private interests engage with the legislative process. 
By emphasizing structure and relationships rather than isolated filings, the project highlights how influence accumulates and operates across issues and time.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- FastAPI
- Vanilla JavaScript
- vis-network (for graph visualization)

## Status
In active development. This project serves as groundwork for the broader Vigil initiative, a long-term civic-tech effort exploring transparency, influence, and public accountability in U.S. governance. 
The larger Vigil project has been pitched at Auburn University and is being developed collaboratively with a small team over time.
